A playground where stories unfold in pixels and soundwaves. From mesmerizing films to mind-bending games, from thought-provoking talks to binge-worthy series—this is where I collect the narratives that inspire, challenge, and entertain me. Some are fresh discoveries, others are old favorites revisited, but all leave a mark on the reel of my mind.

# **Queued Up**
An ever-growing list of media waiting to be played, watched, or listened to. Some are recommendations, others long-overdue classics—I’ll get to them… eventually.
