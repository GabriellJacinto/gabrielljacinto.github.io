Hello, you little stalker!

I'm Gabriel, a tech-loving, library-dwelling, talkative nerd with a knack for both software and hardware.

<!-- Presently working on (...) @ (...) -->

When I’m not buried in books, I’m either making people laugh as a [[library/NUHAS\|Clown Doctor]], jamming on [[library/Live Loops\|multiple instruments]], or chasing my next [[adrenaline rush\|adrenaline rush]].

Feel free to explore the many winding paths of this linked space. If I may suggest, the best way to navigate all the content is through the [tag index](/tags/) or the [recent writing](/library/) index if you prefer a bit of ordered chaos. However, if you truly thrive on entropy - *you mischievous soul* - click on the Graph View!

Still undecided? Check out these collections:
- [[The Radio Silence Atrium\|The Radio Silence Atrium]]: a collection of my favorite thoughts and stream-of-consciousness musings, etched into writing;
- [[The Fool's Workbench\|The Fool's Workbench]]: a collection of projects and ideas I've worked on or am currently tinkering with;
- [[The Creaking Shelf\|The Creaking Shelf]]: a peek into my ever-growing book collection.
- [[The Silver Screen Hub\|The Silver Screen Hub]]: a curated space for all things visual and audible—movies, music, series, podcasts, and games.
