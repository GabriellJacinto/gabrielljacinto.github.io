Welcome!

```

  

Iâ€™m Gabriel, a dedicated, communicative, and charismatic nerdy dude with a passion for both software and hardware exploration. I am driven by a profound sense of purpose to apply my expertise to develop innovative solutions that can alleviate the burden of cognitive disorders and improve the quality of life for affected individuals.

In my spare time, I'm not only a dedicated student and professional but also a Clown Doctor, bringing joy and laughter to those in need. Additionally, I find balance playing the saxophone and guitar.

  

I'm not just a computer scientist; I'm a passionate individual who blends technical expertise with a diverse range of interests and community engagement.



As far as 'about' pages go, I hope this acts as an open invitation into the many winding paths throughout this garden. Here are some places you may want to visit:

  

- [The oak letter desk](/posts/): a collection of my favourite [[thoughts/writing\|writing]];

- [The hand-crafted workbench](thoughts/craft.md): craft I am proud of (websites, talks, workshops, projects, etc.);

- [The bookshelf on the far wall](/books): books that are in some state of read, being read, or to be read.
