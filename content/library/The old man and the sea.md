>[!done]+ How The old man and the sea Changed Me
>The first "grown-up" book I ever read—thanks to my dad’s gentle yet unwavering insistence. Before that, I had only skimmed through children's stories meant to ease me into literacy, so this was an _experience_. A big one. Eight-year-old me was not prepared for the metaphorical depths of Hemingway’s prose (despite [[library/Hemingway on The Old Man and The Sea Symbolism\|his adamant claims that it was just about an old man fishing]]). Maybe I read it exactly as he intended.
>
>If anything, the lesson in perseverance stuck with me. My dad often quotes something along the lines of, _"Maybe today I won't catch a fish, but tomorrow I will. And if not tomorrow, then the next day."_ 
>
>Turns out, that quote is not even on the book.
