>[!done]+ How *Vidas secas* Changed Me
> This book doesn’t just hit—it leaves bruises. A brutal, stripped-down look at life where hope is a luxury no one can afford. No melodrama, no sugarcoating, just the relentless grind of survival in a world that couldn’t care less. The fact that the most human character is the dog speaks volumes to its top notch misanthropy. The part that haunts me is the father scolding his son for asking why the sky is blue—not out of cruelty, but because he doesn’t know the answer. And just like that, curiosity dies, crushed under the weight of ignorance and necessity. Ignorance isn’t inherited; it’s imposed. Probably one of the best depications on how the enviroment can shape someone's life and identity. Reminds me of my grandfather ignoring my dad’s eye problem until it turned into permanent blindness. Some cycles never break.

# Notes

```elite
Prepare o seu coração, pras coisas que eu vou contar
Eu venho lá do sertão, eu venho lá do sertão
Eu venho lá do sertão e posso não lhe agradar
Aprendi a dizer não, ver a morte sem chorar
E a morte, o destino, tudo, a morte o destino, tudo
```
