```elite
there's no color in the universe
	Only in the brain
it matters little
	All eye see is you, gleaming and bright
in this kaleidoscopic mess
	Pale rays, dancing with time
the morning star shines enviously
	We circle, as it tears our skin

But this teetering bulb of dread and dream is too busy to notice.
```
