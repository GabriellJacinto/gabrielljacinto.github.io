>[!done]+ How *The Most Human Human* Changed Me
>This was my first dive into non-fiction AI, and let me tell you, it was a wild ride. The book’s attempt to tackle the philosophical consequences of creating intelligent systems was as ambitious as it was... loosely structured. It gave me a first glimpse into [[library/Ser humano é ser emulsão\|what it might mean to be human]]—though not in any way I’d call clear or definitive. But hey, at least it tried to give us something more profound than "just be yourself."
