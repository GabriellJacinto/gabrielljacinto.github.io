>[!done]+ How Dorian Changed Me
>[[Agnes Obel]] crafts an ethereal, piano-driven piece that feels like wandering through a misty forest at dawn. It’s soft yet powerful, haunting yet comforting. My type of shit. The melody is so seductive, I aspire to come up with something like that. 

# Transcription
A song that sounds like it was plucked straight from a dream—elegant, haunting, and mesmerizing.

# Notes
Another one with some great [[Octave\|octave]] range play. Just delightful to play on the [[Saxophone\|Saxophone]], even though I have a hard time to remember it fully.
