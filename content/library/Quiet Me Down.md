>[!done]+ How Quiet Me Down Changed Me
>[[Ben Howard]]â€™s signature mix of intricate guitar work and reverb-layered vocals creates a song that feels like a lullaby for the restless mind. One of my favorites, I listened to it on repeat while writing [[library/Sand Ship Wreck\|Sand Ship Wreck]]. For all the things, especially the tiny ones, that we cannot change.

# Transcription
If the last sunset of our lives could be turned into music, this song would be it. A meditative, stripped-down piece that feels like a deep sigh in musical form.

# Notes
`December, 2023`- I only transcribed the start as of now. It plays really well with the [[Saxophone\|Saxophone]] and the [[Loop Pedal\|Loop Pedal]] together. 
`October, 2024` - Ben just officially released this one on a special album celebrating the 10th anniversary of [[I Forget Where We Were\|I Forget Where We Were]]. This dude is a master of [[Delayed Gratification\|Delayed Gratification]]. It is a smart strategy to be honest, I wonder if it was done on purpose or if it was his perfectionism gate keeping us from his insightful poetry.
