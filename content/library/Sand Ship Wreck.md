```elite
And this is how the days go by
A sand ship slowly bleating // A sand ship slowly sinking
The shells! Captain's sigh
No amount of whimpering
Shall stop her wavering glide

And say I:
My moonshine,
the sail's gone,
the night's alive,
the crowd's dim,
the water's high,

This vessel is beautiful // Memories are beautiful
But never meant to last
Let's go for a swim
For the beach is vast
```
