```elite
Do you ever look at the moon
and worry
‘Will it ever fall one day?’

Running so fast
Running so far

Can it ever get tired
Or trip on the chasming void
Or lose sight of the light

I can only wish it
A soft landing

Because even the moon is a
shooting star when it falls
after all.
```
\- [[Gabriel Lima Jacinto\|Gabriel Lima Jacinto]], Run fast, never trip
