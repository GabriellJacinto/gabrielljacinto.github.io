You choose purpose, you don’t find or somebody or the universe has drawn for you in some form of destiny. <span class="red">YOU CHOOSE PURPOSE</span>, I can't stress this enough. Most people just let this be an unconscious decision and so they call it fate, don't be like most people. Just pick and stick to it.

If doubt comes, remember: you choose purpose, so if you are thinking of changing, it's going to be the same situation, where you are going to question yourself for lack of certainty. 

It’s zero sum, it ends up in the same place regardless of the choice, just choose the thing you think is worth it, and what I think is worth it is learning, even if it gets hard, because [[library/NEVER SETTLE FOR THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT\|settling for comfort is easy.]] Just choose it and stick to it, there is no such thing as regret, there is only [[Death\|death]], and by then what you chose and did not choose will not matter.
