I'm used to read but very slowly because of how I process the info. My reasoning is too lateral sometimes, but that is how I can better use my brain. 

When I read, firstly my interpretation is rather imagetic, which is great for fiction - I take a fair amount of time to imagine the world and action. The other problem is I digress often to other references, more so I can practice lateral thinking and absorption of the content.

But the best way when Iâ€™m looking forward to just getting the idea is rather read the words and not imagine the scenario, just be more of a pragmatic approach. That works well for articles and news. I think a person who did that very well was `redacted`, I remember her reading speed was insane, I don't know if it correlated with content absorption, but it was impressive. I can't help to feel a bit rushed, almost anxious-like when doing this. I wonder if that is how she got to that point. 

The last option when Iâ€™m really pressed for time is speed reading, but that requires some practice yet, I'm terrible at it. I don't see why I would practice this to be honest, maybe for exams that have a crazy time limit. The prior on is better. `redacted` was also pretty good at this, not naturally, she must have practiced for a while.
