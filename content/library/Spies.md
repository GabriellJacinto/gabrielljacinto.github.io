>[!done]+ How Spies Changed Me
>One of my favorites hidden gem from [[Coldplay]]’s early days, wrapped in mystery and intrigue. It made me want to look over my shoulder when I find myself in various bodies of water... in the best possible way.

# Transcription
Part of [[Parachutes\|Parachutes]], this song combines eerie melodies with cryptic lyrics, making you feel like you’re being watched—but in a poetic way, not a creepy way, I promise.

# Notes
I didn't really have a good time executing this one on the [[Saxophone\|Saxophone]] to be frank. This made me realize that some songs are just inevitably better with some improvised notes to spice things up. I think songs that tend to repeat a lot the theme are more prone to this dissatisfaction. 

Fun fact: I thought the song was about spiders when I was younger. Something on the lines of:

```elite
And the spiders came out of the water  
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know  
But the spiders hide out in every corner  
But you can't touch them no  
'Cause they're all spiders  
They're all spiders
```

And yes, I had arachnophobia.
