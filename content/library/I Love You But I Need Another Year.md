>[!done]+ How I Love You But I Need Another Year Changed Me
>Sometimes, love needs a rain check. A raw and honest confession of needing space despite deep love. The song dances between vulnerability and self-awareness, with lyrics that cut deep and melodies that linger.
# Transcription
A beautifully melancholic tune where Liza Anne lays bare the tension between love and personal growth. It’s like reading a heartfelt letter that was never meant to be sent—but here we are, listening.

# Notes
The name of the album is so funny. I think this was the first one I transcribed, a worthy and fun challenge. I just hate the [[Key Signature\|Key Signature]], it makes such an unnecessary hassle to execute smoothly on the [[Saxophone\|Saxophone]].
