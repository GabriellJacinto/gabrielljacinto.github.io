```elite
The floor is something we must fight against.  
Whilst seemingly mere platform for the human  
stance, it is that place that men fall to.  
I am not dizzy. I stand as a tower, a lighthouse;  
the pale ray of my sentiency flowing from my face.  
  
But should I go dizzy I crash down into the floor;  
my face into the floor, my attention bleeding into  
the cracks of the floor.  
  
Dear horizontal place, I do not wish to be a rug.  
Do not pull at the difficult head, this teetering  
bulb of dread and dream...
