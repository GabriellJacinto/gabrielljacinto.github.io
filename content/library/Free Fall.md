```elite
The world is spinning out of control sometimes 
I can't seem to find my place 
Mind's scattered, 
Stumbling in the mess 

But at least the dishes are clean, 
I guess

I mean
Bare minimum efforts prevent bigger damage
But these prisons of doubt will forever shackle me to the ground

So I rather move foward
I know if I step lightly a drop will never hurt

Let it go
Feel the air
Embrace the uncertanties

Time is patient
Balance comes with practice

In the grand scheme
Do not forget

Be kind to yourself
Let the insecurities dissolve
Because once the path is clear
You'll reach your goal.
```
