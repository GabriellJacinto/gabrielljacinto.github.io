>[!done]+ How *Dark Matter* Changed Me 
>
> Really cool, high-concept sci-fi, very well written, story flows like water—if that water were occasionally interrupted by waves of deep existential dread.Book that gets you thinking about your life choices type of shit. When you’re faced with the idea that every decision has a butterfly effect that could lead to a completely different universe, you start questioning whether you’ve made all the right ones

> It made me realize that we only truly understand [[library/Baseline Meditation\|"every choice counts"]] when we’re faced with a never-ending parade of "what-ifs". It drills in the idea that every choice, no matter how small, can spiral into a completely different version of reality. Is your life really your life, or is it just a string of choices that could’ve easily been different? Definitely got me thinking about how much I take my decisions for granted.
