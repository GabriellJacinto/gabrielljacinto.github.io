When George breaks the dragon's head outside the Natural History Museum he awakes an ancient power. This prehistoric beast, sentry-still for centuries, hunts him down with a terrifying wrath. And this is just the beginning... The taints and spits - statues with opposing natures - are warring forces; wreaking deadly havoc on the city landscape. The World War One gunner offers protection of sorts; and the wisdom of the Sphinx is legendary. But George and his companion Edie are trapped in a world of danger. And worse - they are quite alone. The rest of London is oblivious to their plight. This epic adventure exposes forces long-layered in the fabric of London. After entering its richly original and breathtaking world, the city streets and skyline will never again seem the same!","publisher":"Hachette UK","publishDate":"2011-10-06","totalPage":322,"isbn10":1444908545,"isbn13":9781444908541,"topic":"[[Adventure]]","start":"2013-06-01","finish":"2013-08-01","publish":true,"PassFrontmatter":true}

>[!done]+ How Stoneheart Changed Me
>This book was strangely dark for a juvenile novel. I couldn’t shake the feeling of impending doom the whole time. Despite the heavy, unnecessary descriptions (seriously, we didn’t need every cobblestone explained), I actually enjoyed the world-building—especially the map at the start. The cover’s a classic case of “don’t judge,” but man, it hooked me. Only downside? I wasn’t reading in English back then, so I missed out on the sequels. Maybe I’ll give it another go someday. This is a great london tour idea by the way.
