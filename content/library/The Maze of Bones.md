>[!done]+ How _The Maze of Bones_ Changed Me
>This was a surprisingly fun read, kind of like a palate cleanser from the usual fantasy overdose I was having. I was shocked to see [[Rick Riordan]]’s name on the cover, only to find out the rest of the series was written by different authors—what kind of literary group project is this? I really wanted to continue, but the idea of inconsistent writing scared me off.

>At least I learned there are catacombs under Paris, which is both cool, but what the fuck? Also, trying to explain this plot to [[Rafaela\|Rafaela]] was an absolute nightmare—I think the story might be more convoluted than I originally thought.
