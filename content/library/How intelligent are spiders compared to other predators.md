Spiders are know for their behavior of making webs, that are used for shelter but primarily for food acquisition. This makes them an ambush predator. Are ambush predators more intelligent than pursuit predators of the same genus? (is there such a case anyway?) Or should it be categorized a different type of intelligence? Because I expect that ambush predators to be better strategists regarding where to place themselves. On the other hand, I expect that pursuit predators to have higher coordination and therefore more motor intelligence (even though they also need to strategize to approach the pray).
