	"And this is how the days go by
	A sand ship slowly bleating // A sand ship slowly sinking
	The shells! Captain's sigh
	No amount of whimpering
	Shall stop her wavering glide
	
	And say I:
	My moonshine,
	the sail's gone,
	the night's alive,
	the crowd's dim,
	the water's high,
	
	This vessel is beautiful // Memories are beautiful
	But never meant to last
	Let's go for a swim
	For the beach is vast"
