>[!done] How Tiro ao Álvaro Changed Me
>Makes you appreciate how music can be both sophisticated and fun. [[Adoniran Barbosa\|Adoniran Barbosa]]’s lyrics play with language in a way that makes everyday speech sound poetic. Who knew love could sound like a well-aimed bullet?

# Transcription
A samba classic filled with playful wordplay, humor, and that unmistakable Elis Regina charm. It’s a song that winks at you while tapping its feet.

# Notes
Feels so fresh to play the theme of this song on the [[Saxophone\|Saxophone]], I love the range between the [[Octave\|octaves]].
