In this very first Holmes mystery, the detective introduces himself to Dr. John H. Watson with the puzzling line “You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive,” and so begins Watson’s, and the world’s, fascination with this enigmatic character. In A Study in Scarlet, Doyle presents two equally perplexing mysteries for Holmes to solve one a murder that takes place in the shadowy outskirts of London, in a locked room where the haunting word Rache is written upon the wall, the other a kidnapping set in the American West. Picking up the “scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life,” Holmes demonstrates his uncanny knack for finding the truth, tapping into powers of deduction that still captivate readers today.","publisher":"Modern Library","publishDate":"2007-12-18","totalPage":162,"isbn10":307430480,"isbn13":9780307430489,"topic":"[[Mistery]]","start":"2013-08-25","finish":"2013-12-25","publish":true,"PassFrontmatter":true}

>[!done]+ How A Study in Scarlet Changed Me
> First Sherlock story I read, and man, it's a classic. [[Arthur Conan Doyle\|Doyle]]'s creativity with Sherlock's deductions is unmatched. It probably planted the seed for my brief “I want to be a forensic expert” phase. Taught me to look deeper at the world, like figuring out someone's height from the size of their feet—who knew?
